# Recurrent Neural Network for TV Script generation

I built a Recurrent Neural Network (i.e. RNN) that can be used to generate new TV scripts for the Simpsons show. My dataset consists of scripts from 27 seasons past seasons of the Simpsons.

The RNN is built on TensorFlow, written in Python 3 and is presented via Jupyter Notebook.
